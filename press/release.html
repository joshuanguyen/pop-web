<h2>New video texting app spotlights authentic conversations between close friends.</h2>

<h2>Upgrade from typing to video and elevate talks with friends.</h2>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO - February 19, 2015 - Imagist Labs announced today the immediate availability of Pop - Video Texting for iPhone and iPod Touch users. </p>

<p>Pop is a lo fi video texting app for close friends. Conversations on Pop have the expressiveness of video chats and the convenience of text messaging.</p>

<p>There's no need to set up a video call to chat with friends. Videos on Pop behave like texts. Users chat in real-time or respond to videos when they want.</p>

<p>Features:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Videos last up to 5 seconds.</li>
	<li>Lo fi videos are cheap for everyone.</li>
	<li>Press and hold to record and send a video message.</li>
	<li>Video messages automatically form longer conversations. Swipe to see and hear old messages.</li>
	<li>Messages can be replayed indefinitely.</li>
	<li>Bold pop filters enhance faces. Drag toggle to swap colors.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Research suggests that faces, voices and gestures make up 93% of human communication. Pop lets users show friends how they're feeling at any given moment, giving context to conversations that are richer and more authentic than text messages.</p>

<p>“I was frustrated with video chat, voicemail, and texting. ” said Alaric Cole, co-founder of Pop. “So I built something to take the best from each, with none of the annoyances.”</p>

<p>Pop’s compressed videos are designed with poor network conditions and budget data plans in mind.</p>

<p>Pop is ideal for close friends and family who want a convenient and expressive way to talk to one another.</p>
